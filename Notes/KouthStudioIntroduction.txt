Hey My Name is Jakob, I've been a software Engineer for roughly 4 years now and have a few years learning and creating projects prior to my employment. 
I have small scattered amounts of experience creating Games dating back to my first project, a Rough C++ based Game Engine. It wasn't much but the process taught me
the fundalmentals of programming as I took a lower level approach from using OpenGL and a simple Text Editor to creating my own Makefiles and window contexts.

Now I spend most of my personal dev time wrenching an Unreal Engine project for a SideScroller I've been wanting to make for quite some time. Despite the ambitious aspirations
this project has been something I've been working on for over a year now and I want to showcase not only the game, but what I've learned about Unreal Engine and game programming along the way.

So if that's your beat stick around from some tutorials and be on the lookout for the rough demo of my first real project dropping on itch.io
