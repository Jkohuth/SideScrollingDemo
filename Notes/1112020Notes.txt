My lack of clearly defined class structure is becoming a problem as a struggle to trigger the proper events as I keep making different types of enemies. I want to have a base enemy class or controller that contains all the necessary interactions with the player of with other types of objects.

I learned a bit about timelines which is a SIGNIFICANT upgrade to trying to come up with some magic inside a Tick function. Need to finialize enemy designs and translate them all to C++ since I find blueprint dangerous and prone to failure. If I have to recompile blueprints and they get corrupted it really kills my mood.

My game is coming together to an extent, the wall enemy is too intrusive than original anticipated, perhaps I can make it thinner in order to avoid making it an extreme obstacle. 

Still haven't spent the time to learn the underpinnings of UE4, kinda doing a learning as I go type of situation which isn't bad but clearly has some serious flaws which is why I am on the third redesign of this game. But progress is progress and I am very satisfyed with what i have accomplished so far.

I still need to work on a game design document as illustrating my goals and aspirations for other people can keep me focused and know where to go next.

Editting the "Focus" mode is the next step I want the player movements to be extreme and exaggerated. However that needs to be stored in a USTRUCT and I still haven't properly learned those et

I keep attempting to use mr mannequin but honestly I should just use shapetraces in order to get the gameplay across of what I want to accomplish, there are no proper attack animations that fit with the feel and style I am attempting to convey. Those collisions need to ignore the player though
