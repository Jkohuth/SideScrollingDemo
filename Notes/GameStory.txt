The cold morning air rested softly on my eyelids. Shut... heavy... carrying the weight of days better forgotten. As i wake from my deep sleep, I try not to stir, not disturbing the still of the air warmed around me.
As the warm suns gaze peaks over to my lifeless body, I begin to slowly open my eyes and lift myself up. 

The morning air resting gently on a boys eyes. Shut, heavy, carrying the weight of days impossible to forget. Waking from the slumber he motions slowly, not trying to disturb the still warm air that enveloped him. 
As the sun slowly peaked over the horizon the dark vacant eyes reveal themselves.	Stretching far enough as if to reach the sky the vacant eyes of a young farmer gazed longingly at the sunrise.

He is wearing (passive) a dark grey tunic, missing a sleeve, accented by the blood red undershirt with a large full neck collar. His dark blue jeans and black worn drawn shoes barely grasping any attention. His pale skin and shadow tinged
eyelids accented his gaunt cheekbones. His head shaved on both sides had slicked back blonde hair. He walked over by the large oak that granted him refuged and picked up the scythe lying gently against the trunk. After feeling the weight of the farmers tool he cut it across the air.
