Currently I set up my game to function with a PS4 controller to a strangely warm reception. Excited that its playable and more satisfying with a game controller

The game needs to be more mathematical, not in the nature of being about math but in the precision of the jumps, the seperation of obstacles the margins of error.
Unfortunately I cannot commit to something like until I have enough gameplay to decide what the definite must be, however the desire to spread platforms based on current
settings seems really engaging. 

Fixed the Wall bug where the character would fall off if not enough of the capsule overlapped with the wall. 
	Will Need to be added back in for the "Roll" mechanic but thats a feature request

On sense player it will trigger a delay timer
	During Timer:
		Material Color will change
		it will stop moving for a brief moment

	TakeDamage
		Enemy Material color will change




Tasks:
blen
	Implement Melee Attack/Collision - Done: Used Rama melee weapon, if you want to reinvent the wheel roll your own engine

	Rail grinding... again (spinning my wheels a bit) - Works but has flaws, isn't as expansive as initially desired

	Combat
		Wall Slash animation
		Air Jump Animation
		Perry?

	
	make some basic particle physics for health

	intro -> Resting to play

Fixes Done Today

Corrected module loading "/Project/Shaders" to not throw exception
Fixed Jumping to look more natural when lands`
Listed Bugs and fixes required

__________________________________________________________________________

	Bugs:
		Jumping off a falling platform does short jump instead of full jump

		Sliding down rails that have no endings causes player to glitch out

Updraft Needs particles and tweeking - set cap on upward velocity

Rest Areas
	Rest Animations
	Mesh for character to sit/relax on
	Refill bars

Focus
	Post Processing Material - Demonstrate effect
	Decide on how much it "Juices" the character
	Link with Rail for sick rail jumps

Death Animation
	New mesh cause death animation to fail - retarget

2020-05-29


	Rail Grinding - Goodish no bugs moves as expected

	Repaired Respawn after changing Skeletal mesh

	TODO: Tasklist 2020-05-30
		After a few bug fixes I decided laying out tasks and ideas was a better way of finding things to check off

		Focus Movement
			Create UStruct to hold modified movement components
				Create Functions to swap between normal and focus mode
				Increase Jump Velocity in focus mode
		Animation
			Wall Animation
			GroundIdle (replace current ground idle as transitioning causes scythe to clip through body)
			Resting - (Import already made resting animation -> retarget)



		Particles
			Updraft Wind
			Rest Area + Mesh

		Shaders
			Focus Shader
				Have postprocessing shader form a radius that can be altered around the player

		Mesh
			Enemy Frog
				Unpair skeletal bones from mirror mesh
				Walk
				Lunge (Bite?)
				Alert
			Only Attack when within screen view

		Enemies
			Create Enemy Bird prototype


		Environment
			BackGrounds
				Massage into level fjord style background

2020-05-30

		Enemy Frog Mes
			Mirrored bones
			Setup Vertex groups
			Set up stackoverflow question on how to not get the mirror modifier in pose mode (https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/180556/armature-rotates-both-sides-of-mirrored-mesh/180561#180561)

			Duplicated Blueprint and C++ class to rename from EnemyCharacter->EnemyFrog
			Added it to collision_ENEMY channel (Actually reverted to Pawn as there was some issues with that)
			Added delay to Frog Lunge

	TODO TaskList:
		Player Hit cooldown (don't let repeated hits stack)

2020-05-31
	
	Fixed LevelBoundingBox - Works with Process Now
	Found out can't import .usf files revert module (for now)
	Added UStruct to PlayerMovementComponent

	Attempted Rest_idle/Rest_stop/Ground_idle/GroundAtk_1 - Varying success

2020-06-03

	Tweaked some animations and exported them to Unreal
	Idle -> Run looks good
		Need to make custom Jump animation
	Neutral attack is fine standing still
		looks awkward when running
			Lean forward attack?

2020-06-04 - Morning
	Messed Around with wall movement animations and Jumping

	Started working on a post processing shader
		Doesn't work but its a start, the code compiles but isn't localized

		Perhaps creating a sphere object and changing the radius of that with a material (not post process) can yield the desire effect

	TODO:
		Put these notes in Excel or excel like program: start tracking time

2020-06-17
	Added a view plane to the camera and created a decent enough material to work with it

	TODO:
		Gameplay of Focus Movement

		Create Bird Enemy

		Add Fade in and Fade out of material based on button press

		Working Title Leeres Volk
