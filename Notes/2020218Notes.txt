Currently I set up my game to function with a PS4 controller to a strangely warm reception. Excited that its playable and more satisfying with a game controller

The game needs to be more mathematical, not in the nature of being about math but in the precision of the jumps, the seperation of obstacles the margins of error.
Unfortunately I cannot commit to something like until I have enough gameplay to decide what the definite must be, however the desire to spread platforms based on current
settings seems really engaging. 

Fixed the Wall bug where the character would fall off if not enough of the capsule overlapped with the wall.
