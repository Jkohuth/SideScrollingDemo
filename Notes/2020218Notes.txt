Currently I set up my game to function with a PS4 controller to a strangely warm reception. Excited that its playable and more satisfying with a game controller

The game needs to be more mathematical, not in the nature of being about math but in the precision of the jumps, the seperation of obstacles the margins of error.
Unfortunately I cannot commit to something like until I have enough gameplay to decide what the definite must be, however the desire to spread platforms based on current
settings seems really engaging. 

Fixed the Wall bug where the character would fall off if not enough of the capsule overlapped with the wall. 
	Will Need to be added back in for the "Roll" mechanic but thats a feature request

On sense player it will trigger a delay timer
	During Timer:
		Material Color will change
		it will stop moving for a brief moment

	TakeDamage
		Enemy Material color will change




Tasks:
blen
	Implement Melee Attack/Collision - Done: Used Rama melee weapon, if you want to reinvent the wheel roll your own engine

	Rail grinding... again (spinning my wheels a bit) - Works but has flaws, isn't as expansive as initially desired

	Combat
		Wall Slash animation
		Air Jump Animation
		Perry?

	
	make some basic particle physics for health

Fixes Done Today

Corrected module loading "/Project/Shaders" to not throw exception
Fixed Jumping to look more natural when lands`
Listed Bugs and fixes required

__________________________________________________________________________

	Bugs:
		Jumping off a falling platform does short jump instead of full jump

		Sliding down rails that have no endings causes player to glitch out

Updraft Needs particles and tweeking - set cap on upward velocity

Rest Areas
	Rest Animations
	Mesh for character to sit/relax on
	Refill bars

Focus
	Post Processing Material - Demonstrate effect
	Decide on how much it "Juices" the character
	Link with Rail for sick rail jumps

Death Animation
	New mesh cause death animation to fail - retarget

2020-05-29


	Rail Grinding - Goodish no bugs moves as expected

	Repaired Respawn after changing Skeletal mesh

	TODO: Tasklist 2020-05-30
		After a few bug fixes I decided laying out tasks and ideas was a better way of finding things to check off

		Focus Movement
			Create UStruct to hold modified movement components
				Create Functions to swap between normal and focus mode
				Increase Jump Velocity in focus mode
		Animation
			Wall Animation
			GroundIdle (replace current ground idle as transitioning causes scythe to clip through body)
			Resting - (Import already made resting animation -> retarget)



		Particles
			Updraft Wind
			Rest Area + Mesh

		Shaders
			Focus Shader
				Have postprocessing shader form a radius that can be altered around the player

		Mesh
			Enemy Frog
				Unpair skeletal bones from mirror mesh
				Walk
				Lunge (Bite?)
				Alert
			Only Attack when within screen view

		Enemies
			Create Enemy Bird prototype


		Environment
			BackGrounds
				Massage into level fjord style background

2020-05-30

		Enemy Frog Mes
			Mirrored bones
			Setup Vertex groups
			Set up stackoverflow question on how to not get the mirror modifier in pose mode (https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/180556/armature-rotates-both-sides-of-mirrored-mesh/180561#180561)

			Duplicated Blueprint and C++ class to rename from EnemyCharacter->EnemyFrog
			Added it to collision_ENEMY channel (Actually reverted to Pawn as there was some issues with that)
			Added delay to Frog Lunge

	TODO TaskList:
		Player Hit cooldown (don't let repeated hits stack)

2020-05-31
	
	Fixed LevelBoundingBox - Works with Process Now
	Found out can't import .usf files revert module (for now)
	Added UStruct to PlayerMovementComponent

	Attempted Rest_idle/Rest_stop/Ground_idle/GroundAtk_1 - Varying success

2020-06-03

	Tweaked some animations and exported them to Unreal
	Idle -> Run looks good
		Need to make custom Jump animation
	Neutral attack is fine standing still
		looks awkward when running
			Lean forward attack?

2020-06-04 - Morning
	Messed Around with wall movement animations and Jumping

	Started working on a post processing shader
		Doesn't work but its a start, the code compiles but isn't localized

		Perhaps creating a sphere object and changing the radius of that with a material (not post process) can yield the desire effect

	TODO:
		Put these notes in Excel or excel like program: start tracking time

2020-06-17
	Added a view plane to the camera and created a decent enough material to work with it

	TODO:
		Gameplay of Focus Movement

		Create Bird Enemy

		Add Fade in and Fade out of material based on button press

		Working Title Leeres Volk

2020-09-01
	I have been working on the game sparingly not as much as Id like for this 3 month gap

	TODO:
		Fix Swing Movement Offset

			First step diagonse what is happening
2020-09-02
	
	Accomplished:
		Swing movements errors are occuring when the players height exceeds that of the pivot, as tension is still being applied when the character should be in freefall

	TODO:
		Fix Swing movement bug
		Add player input for swing movement

2020-09-05
	
	Tinkered with the Swing Movement, its getting there

	Added Frog Mesh with materials to game

2020-09-13
	This is more of an overview of what was accomplished over the weekend
	The main menu in all its glory is roughly complete, with the character resting idle post and Display name available along with a press start animation widget

	TODO:
		Fix crashing bug when player is handled in editor <- BIG ISSUE NEEDS ADDRESSing
		Polish Swing Movement <- Do not allow character to perform loops around the pivot
			Also work in 1D blend space in order to have character actually rotating

		Fix Grinding mechanic so that it can actually be used

		Fix Focus Effect
			Main Gimmick is painfully underdeveloped however its worth wrenching on after the movement modes are created

		Add Bird enemy

		Add Credits

	Title Screen Main Menu

	Wall Sliding and C++ PhysCustom

2020-09-18
	
	Work have progressed slowly as I haven't poured a decent amount of hours into the game recently. However I did locate and remove the UE4 crashing bug that plagued my game
		Using EditAnywhere on ActorComponents causes read access violation which is a tad suprising 

	TODO:
		Find and Fix grinding mechanic bug

		Improve enemy AI - Don't have them walk into bottomless pits (leaping into them is allowed)

2020-09-21
	
	Worked on Spline Mesh Component, the autoscaling is proportional to the direction that the spline point is at, needs work

	TODO:
		Add Capsule/Sphere/Cube Component at the beginning and end of a spline mesh to know when not rail grinding anymore
		Figure out how to reduce mesh size for different direction
2020-09-24
	Narrowed down that the view plane attached to my ActorComponent was constantly causing the crashes

2020-09-25
	No work done today but I wanted to make a TODO list for tomorrow

	TODO:
		Fix Shape plane effect

		Expand level to introduce mechanics

		Bird Enemy

		Fix Bug with pendulum swinging

		Lower max velocity when attacking ( Sound effect comes in later )

2020-09-26
	
	Changed the shape plane location to Begin Play instead of the constructor and havent incountered any issues regarding that

	Need to find ideal way of storing information between modes
	

	I have the player movement handler class so it might be best to just create a handful of player movements

	Perhaps for the movement would be more interesting to use 1 health and it stays active for a few moments of time

	Kinematics Different Versions per movement mode:
		- Walking
		- Walking + attacking 
					Slight drop in speed
		- Walking + Focus
					Increase in speed, decrease in friction, Jump Velocity?
		- Walking + Focus + Attacking

		- Falling
		- Falling + Attacking 
					Slight drop in air control
		- Falling + Focus
					Fall faster? More or less air control
		- Falling + Focus + Attacking


		- Swing 
		- Swing + Focus
					Increase in pendulum swing Acceleration
			*note cannot attack while swinging

		- Wall Slide
		- Wall Slide + Attacking
				Change nothing
		- Wall Slide + Focus
				Increased horizontal jump velocity?
		- Wall Slide + Focus + Attacking

		- Grinding....



		Things to take note for this handler
		MaxSwingAccel
		PendulumFriction

		MaxGrindAccel
		MaxGrindSpeed
		GrindFriction

	TODO:
		Make the bird

	Enemy Pawn
		Static (Eventually Skeletal) mesh
		SphereComponent
		ArrowComponent
		PawnSensing 

		Behavior: The bird will fly back and forth around a set area perhaps in an oscillating fashion?
					If it senses the player and is in the viewport
						Pause and then dive towards the player
						Go back to idling in a circle and after a set amount of time if player is still in view attack again
				Will it keep following the player? Right now no



		Particle Effects:
			Healing 
			Drips coming from Falling Icicles 
			Wind Wisps from updraft

		Remake the special effect to not be a bar but to take the health and let it persist for a defined amount of time

2020-09-28
	
	Made the skeleton for the Enemy Bird, no functionality yet looking in determining object rendering

2020-09-29
	TODO: 
		Finish making the Bird

		Mess around with the pendulum physics as it does not feel great

	Accomplished
		Actually big brained the pendulum physics and got a better functioning version of what was in place, now its more realistic however carry over velocity still has the player rotate around the pivot

2020-10-09
	Long time since I last worked on my game project with the trip to ohio a welcomed one but throwing me off what I am use to, its 6:37AM and I don't really have any drive or idea of what to 
	work on right now. Perhaps I should've immediately started working on something as soon as I woke

	Spent 10 minutes trying to install a plugin that broke my build and then reverted it. I have no discipline today
2020-10-11 
	Yesterday was dedicated entirely to (seperate) Music and I didn't make a ton of progress in that regard. Feeling refreshed and more focused I want to spend at least 30 minutes today wrenching on particular tasks

	Tasks:
		EnemyBird - When rendered on screen wait for a moment and fly towards character
						Steps:
							Determine when rendered on screen - Debug logs - DONE
							When rendered on screen move towards player - location at that exact instance, no chasing
							when rendered on screen pause for a minute and then move towards player
							Only move towards player when in Pawn Sensing Radius
							Give it Idle movement

		PhysSwing - Don't want character doing loops around the swing
					Make animation of character swinging, 1D animation blend of y-Axis distance from the pivot


2020-10-12
	Updated Character Attack Animation so you cant repeatedly slam the attack button, now attack can only be used OnSwingEnd flag triggered

	Fixed PawnSensing on EnemyBird

2020-10-13
	No work done

2020-10-14
	Let's work on the PhysSwing aspect for now and take a break from the bird

	Did a bit of introductory level design on pen/paper
	Put in the 1D blend space for swing animation - will require more exagerrated movements and possibly a 2D blend space to deal with height

	TODO:
		Swing Animations
		Swing Movement Logic you've been neglecting
		Bird Movement See 10-11 steps
		Particle Wind Effect
		Particle Healing Effect

		Test out different focus movement
		Revamp level design

		Sound FX
		Music

2020-10-16
	Not super productive learned about Unreals style of AI including BlackBoards and Behavior trees, working on redefining movement for Frog character to not be hardcoded

2020-10-17
	TODO: 
		Work on behavior trees for Enemy AI, use frog as starting point
			RoadMap:
				Frog
					Walk back and forth from a central point (perhaps a specific point would be better)
					OnSeePawn trigger Attack

		Redesign Level

		Sound Fx
			Player:
				Scythe Slash
				Footstep
			Enemy:
				Frog:
					Growl
					Alert
					Leap
					Footstep
			Bird:
				Bird:
					Caw
					Wing Flap
			Worm:
				????

		Particle Effects:
			Dust trail on heavy landing

			Health spot particles

			Wind Wisps

			Sparks from enemy destruction


2020-10-21/22
	Watched a tutorial on the basics of AI in Unreal to round out my knowledge of what I needed to know, didn't finish tutorial as I don't require complex AI for this game

	Learned Hotkeys:
		 ' - in game mode to show Debug
		 1, 2, 3, 4 - To toggle from Numpad once in debug mode
		 alt + click - to immediately disconnect nodes
		 F7 - to compile blueprints
		 
	Finished Frog AI, needs polish
