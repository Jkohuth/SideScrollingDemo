Currently I set up my game to function with a PS4 controller to a strangely warm reception. Excited that its playable and more satisfying with a game controller

The game needs to be more mathematical, not in the nature of being about math but in the precision of the jumps, the seperation of obstacles the margins of error.
Unfortunately I cannot commit to something like until I have enough gameplay to decide what the definite must be, however the desire to spread platforms based on current
settings seems really engaging. 

Fixed the Wall bug where the character would fall off if not enough of the capsule overlapped with the wall. 
	Will Need to be added back in for the "Roll" mechanic but thats a feature request

Fixes Done Today

Corrected module loading "/Project/Shaders" to not throw exception
Fixed Jumping to look more natural when lands`
Listed Bugs and fixes required

__________________________________________________________________________

	Bugs:
		Jumping off a falling platform does short jump instead of full jump

		Sliding down rails that have no endings causes player to glitch out

Updraft Needs particles and tweeking - set cap on upward velocity

Rest Areas
	Rest Animations
	Mesh for character to sit/relax on
	Refill bars

Focus
	Post Processing Material - Demonstrate effect
	Decide on how much it "Juices" the character
	Link with Rail for sick rail jumps

Death Animation
	New mesh cause death animation to fail - retarget

2020-05-29


	Rail Grinding - Goodish no bugs moves as expected

	Repaired Respawn after changing Skeletal mesh

	TODO: Tasklist 2020-05-30
		After a few bug fixes I decided laying out tasks and ideas was a better way of finding things to check off

		Focus Movement
			Create UStruct to hold modified movement components
				Create Functions to swap between normal and focus mode
				Increase Jump Velocity in focus mode
		Animation
			Wall Animation
			GroundIdle (replace current ground idle as transitioning causes scythe to clip through body)
			Resting - (Import already made resting animation -> retarget)



		Particles
			Updraft Wind
			Rest Area + Mesh

		Shaders
			Focus Shader
				Have postprocessing shader form a radius that can be altered around the player

		Mesh
			Enemy Frog
				Unpair skeletal bones from mirror mesh
				Walk
				Lunge (Bite?)
				Alert
			Only Attack when within screen view

		Enemies
			Create Enemy Bird prototype


		Environment
			BackGrounds
				Massage into level fjord style background

2020-05-30

		Enemy Frog Mes
			Mirrored bones
			Setup Vertex groups
			Set up stackoverflow question on how to not get the mirror modifier in pose mode (https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/180556/armature-rotates-both-sides-of-mirrored-mesh/180561#180561)

			Duplicated Blueprint and C++ class to rename from EnemyCharacter->EnemyFrog
			Added it to collision_ENEMY channel (Actually reverted to Pawn as there was some issues with that)
			Added delay to Frog Lunge

	TODO TaskList:
		Player Hit cooldown (don't let repeated hits stack)

2020-05-31
	
	Fixed LevelBoundingBox - Works with Process Now
	Found out can't import .usf files revert module (for now)
	Added UStruct to PlayerMovementComponent

	Attempted Rest_idle/Rest_stop/Ground_idle/GroundAtk_1 - Varying success

2020-06-03

	Tweaked some animations and exported them to Unreal
	Idle -> Run looks good
		Need to make custom Jump animation
	Neutral attack is fine standing still
		looks awkward when running
			Lean forward attack?

2020-06-04 - Morning
	Messed Around with wall movement animations and Jumping

	Started working on a post processing shader
		Doesn't work but its a start, the code compiles but isn't localized

		Perhaps creating a sphere object and changing the radius of that with a material (not post process) can yield the desire effect

	TODO:
		Put these notes in Excel or excel like program: start tracking time

2020-06-17
	Added a view plane to the camera and created a decent enough material to work with it

	TODO:
		Gameplay of Focus Movement

		Create Bird Enemy

		Add Fade in and Fade out of material based on button press

		Working Title Leeres Volk

2020-09-01
	I have been working on the game sparingly not as much as Id like for this 3 month gap

	TODO:
		Fix Swing Movement Offset

			First step diagonse what is happening
2020-09-02
	
	Accomplished:
		Swing movements errors are occuring when the players height exceeds that of the pivot, as tension is still being applied when the character should be in freefall

	TODO:
		Fix Swing movement bug
		Add player input for swing movement

2020-09-05
	
	Tinkered with the Swing Movement, its getting there

	Added Frog Mesh with materials to game

2020-09-13
	This is more of an overview of what was accomplished over the weekend
	The main menu in all its glory is roughly complete, with the character resting idle post and Display name available along with a press start animation widget

	TODO:
		Fix crashing bug when player is handled in editor <- BIG ISSUE NEEDS ADDRESSing
		Polish Swing Movement <- Do not allow character to perform loops around the pivot
			Also work in 1D blend space in order to have character actually rotating

		Fix Grinding mechanic so that it can actually be used

		Fix Focus Effect
			Main Gimmick is painfully underdeveloped however its worth wrenching on after the movement modes are created

		Add Bird enemy

		Add Credits

2020-09-18
	
	Work have progressed slowly as I haven't poured a decent amount of hours into the game recently. However I did locate and remove the UE4 crashing bug that plagued my game
		Using EditAnywhere on ActorComponents causes read access violation which is a tad suprising 

	TODO:
		Find and Fix grinding mechanic bug

		Improve enemy AI - Don't have them walk into bottomless pits (leaping into them is allowed)

2020-09-21
	
	Worked on Spline Mesh Component, the autoscaling is proportional to the direction that the spline point is at, needs work

	TODO:
		Add Capsule/Sphere/Cube Component at the beginning and end of a spline mesh to know when not rail grinding anymore
		Figure out how to reduce mesh size for different direction
2020-09-24
	Narrowed down that the view plane attached to my ActorComponent was constantly causing the crashes

2020-09-25
	No work done today but I wanted to make a TODO list for tomorrow

	TODO:
		Fix Shape plane effect

		Expand level to introduce mechanics

		Bird Enemy

		Fix Bug with pendulum swinging

		Lower max velocity when attacking ( Sound effect comes in later )

2020-09-26
	
	Changed the shape plane location to Begin Play instead of the constructor and havent incountered any issues regarding that

	Need to find ideal way of storing information between modes
	

	I have the player movement handler class so it might be best to just create a handful of player movements

	Perhaps for the movement would be more interesting to use 1 health and it stays active for a few moments of time

	Kinematics Different Versions per movement mode:
		- Walking
		- Walking + attacking 
					Slight drop in speed
		- Walking + Focus
					Increase in speed, decrease in friction, Jump Velocity?
		- Walking + Focus + Attacking

		- Falling
		- Falling + Attacking 
					Slight drop in air control
		- Falling + Focus
					Fall faster? More or less air control
		- Falling + Focus + Attacking


		- Swing 
		- Swing + Focus
					Increase in pendulum swing Acceleration
			*note cannot attack while swinging

		- Wall Slide
		- Wall Slide + Attacking
				Change nothing
		- Wall Slide + Focus
				Increased horizontal jump velocity?
		- Wall Slide + Focus + Attacking

		- Grinding....



		Things to take note for this handler
		MaxSwingAccel
		PendulumFriction

		MaxGrindAccel
		MaxGrindSpeed

	TODO:
		Make the bird

	Enemy Pawn
		Static (Eventually Skeletal) mesh
		SphereComponent
		ArrowComponent
		PawnSensing 

		Behavior: The bird will fly back and forth around a set area perhaps in an oscillating fashion?
					If it senses the player and is in the viewport
						Pause and then dive towards the player
						Go back to idling in a circle and after a set amount of time if player is still in view attack again
				Will it keep following the player? Right now no



		Particle Effects:
			Healing 
			Drips coming from Falling Icicles 
			Wind Wisps from updraft

		Remake the special effect to not be a bar but to take the health and let it persist for a defined amount of time

2020-09-28
	
	Made the skeleton for the Enemy Bird, no functionality yet looking in determining object rendering

2020-09-29
	TODO: 
		Finish making the Bird

		Mess around with the pendulum physics as it does not feel great

	Accomplished
		Actually big brained the pendulum physics and got a better functioning version of what was in place, now its more realistic however carry over velocity still has the player rotate around the pivot

2020-10-09
	Long time since I last worked on my game project with the trip to ohio a welcomed one but throwing me off what I am use to, its 6:37AM and I don't really have any drive or idea of what to 
	work on right now. Perhaps I should've immediately started working on something as soon as I woke

	Spent 10 minutes trying to install a plugin that broke my build and then reverted it. I have no discipline today
2020-10-11 
	Yesterday was dedicated entirely to (seperate) Music and I didn't make a ton of progress in that regard. Feeling refreshed and more focused I want to spend at least 30 minutes today wrenching on particular tasks

	Tasks:
		EnemyBird - When rendered on screen wait for a moment and fly towards character
						Steps:
							Determine when rendered on screen - Debug logs - DONE
							When rendered on screen move towards player - location at that exact instance, no chasing
							when rendered on screen pause for a minute and then move towards player
							Only move towards player when in Pawn Sensing Radius
							Give it Idle movement

		PhysSwing - Don't want character doing loops around the swing
					Make animation of character swinging, 1D animation blend of y-Axis distance from the pivot


2020-10-12
	Updated Character Attack Animation so you cant repeatedly slam the attack button, now attack can only be used OnSwingEnd flag triggered

	Fixed PawnSensing on EnemyBird

2020-10-13
	No work done

2020-10-14
	Let's work on the PhysSwing aspect for now and take a break from the bird

	Did a bit of introductory level design on pen/paper
	Put in the 1D blend space for swing animation - will require more exagerrated movements and possibly a 2D blend space to deal with height

	TODO:
		Swing Animations
		Swing Movement Logic you've been neglecting
		Bird Movement See 10-11 steps
		Particle Wind Effect
		Particle Healing Effect

		Test out different focus movement
		Revamp level design

		Sound FX
		Music

2020-10-16
	Not super productive learned about Unreals style of AI including BlackBoards and Behavior trees, working on redefining movement for Frog character to not be hardcoded

2020-10-17
	TODO: 
		Work on behavior trees for Enemy AI, use frog as starting point
			RoadMap:
				Frog
					Walk back and forth from a central point (perhaps a specific point would be better)
					OnSeePawn trigger Attack

		Redesign Level

		Sound Fx
			Player:
				Scythe Slash
				Footstep
			Enemy:
				Frog:
					Growl
					Alert
					Leap
					Footstep
			Bird:
				Bird:
					Caw
					Wing Flap
			Worm:

		Particle Effects:
			Dust trail on heavy landing

			Health spot particles

			Wind Wisps

			Sparks from enemy destruction


2020-10-21/22
	Watched a tutorial on the basics of AI in Unreal to round out my knowledge of what I needed to know, didn't finish tutorial as I don't require complex AI for this game

	Learned Hotkeys:
		 ' - in game mode to show Debug
		 1, 2, 3, 4 - To toggle from Numpad once in debug mode
		 alt + click - to immediately disconnect nodes
		 F7 - to compile blueprints
		 
	Finished Frog AI, needs polish

2020-10-23/25
	Did quite a bit over the past few days, predominantly ironed out all the kinks in AI with the frog. Now it uses AI perception and can have its main values set, attacks player and has a cooldown

	Working on EnemyHawk now, got the basics down but floating pawn movement component doesn't respond well to basic MoveTo AI functions so I'll have to do something a bit more homegrown or make it a character

	Also Quick fix character no longer rotates when swinging

2020-10-26
	I feel very close to finishing a demo of my game while simultaneously having a billion tweaks that need to be implemented. As these notes splintered into more of the thoughts about
	what was accomplished today than what needs to be done I am thinking of making an excel spreadsheet to keep track of task and more importantly time (recorded) time management

	Perhaps swallow your pride and make the bird a character? Although I feel as though I need to prove to myself I can make the correct movment mode with just a floatingPawnMovementComponent

	Started on a spreadsheet to take care of the remaining tasks I had in mind

	Spent some time working out floating pawn movement for the bird, not sure if this is a waste as making it a character would give me a lot of advantage, who am I trying to impress? mysefl? If thats the case youshouldn't even be using unreal

2020-10-29
	Took a break from caffeine which for some reason also meant taking a break from working on the game. Still I'll probably tackle something simple today, so I'll work on either level design or 
	destructible wall (objects)

	Did some level design and watched a tutorial on destructible objects, did not implement
2020-10-31
	Happy Halloween 5 day coffee clense is over now it time to get back to work

	My aim today is to squash bugs and build more of a level and boy do I have a ton of bugs to squash

	Accomplished quite a lot today surprisingly

	Fixed falling platform jump and corrected the time
	Made more of the playable level
	Added camera panning up and down when stationary
	Worked on Pendulum movement
2020-11-2
	Created more of the intro sequence of the level

	TODO:
		Destrutible Wall
		Swing Movement
		Hawk AI/Movement
2020-11-15
	Election has kept me anxious and ruined my ability to focus, however that is on the back burner and there is a game I that I want to make.

	Gameplay Hurdles:
		Swing Movement:
			No Animation
			Character can swing all the way around
				- Perhaps a hard stop to all velocity when character reaches a certain apex?
				- Clamp the velocity of the player when he starts the physSwing movement

		Climb Movement:
			Misnomer Wall Slide is more accurate 
			Rotate character to face away from the wall on trigger regardless of current rotation
				With a variation of 360 degrees of what the character can be when hitting the wall need to 
					A. Find Character Roatation Angle that points away from the wall
					B. Rotate character by that amount

				FINISHED: Set values to hardcoded toward or away from wall, only works in 2D but this project needs to be finished

2020-11-16
	I am going to mess around with pendulum movement to see if I can get the desired effect

	Cause: I don't have true pendulum movement implemented instead I have a rotational movement with a lock on how far the character can divert from the path

	Resolution: Temporary but I now set the characters Y velocity to 0.f when its horizontal to the swing. Once again not true pendulum movement but it works in the short term

2020-11-17
	Movement Mechanics or level design? I don't know what I should work on at this moment, but I feel like level design could do more to further my game along

	So far I've built out my level a bit more, and have exposed them to everything they will encounter in the level. Acting as a "Tutorial" Stage. Now I want to create a 2 way path that will split to a 
	3 way path that will converge at 1 path at the end of the level.

	Reasons for taking more difficult path? Items? Cutscene (yeah right) Powerups most likely

	Bug found on falling platform player teleports with platform

	Did a lot of level design but still not hitting the interesting nail on the head yet, needs more work across the board in expanding and making the level

	Bounding box bugs with respect to camera movement in new area

2020-11-19
	Exploring the errors with level Camera Bounds and why the camera won't follow the bounds I added in the new level

	SOLVED: The camera bounding box wasn't overlapping properly based on the location, It didn't overlap with it in its default position because on spawn the players bounding box already overlapped with it slightly

2020-11-20
	Began by working on Level design a little bit only to discover that the pendulum movement is very slow and boring despite me tweaking the values. Need to once again adjust the values in order to 
	have a more fluid experience 

	Looks as though something is consuming my acceleration Vector

	Spikes in cave fall to fast and due more damage than they should needs to be adjusted

2020-11-21
	If I decide to rework the pendulum movment I should express the motion in terms of energy and not in terms of velocity. I need to figure out why the friction/tension isn't being applied
	in the x (Y) direction as well. Manually setting it to zero on the surface resolves my issue but doesn't actually address the problem.

	Check if the acceleration based on player input is actually adding any value

	Bug found in swing movment because attacking is required to activate MOVE_SWING the characters swing acceleration gets overriden by the acceleration limiter when attacking 

2020-11-22
	Tooks some notes on the scenes I want to see in the game and the way they would be played out. I may want to draw some pictures of the screen.

	Pendulum movement still doesn't feel right, may add additional movement when jumping off and see if that is a good fit

	Background needs to be added so that when on empty platforms you can get a grasp for movement
	Perhaps fix the rotation of the character speed
	Make sure Camera doesn't clip into environment

	Foot Step sounds FX Find some
	Clink sound effect when entering pendulum movement
	Perhaps set velocity (or make it approach 0) as you get to a certain angle above the pivot

	11:11 - Going to begin spending time decorating and adding stylistic flare to the level

	11:30 - Lot of options for SFX, may want to do more level design to get a feel for what I want first
			May spend some money on stylized water shader

	11:44 - Bug Report put limit on negative velocity when updrafting

	11:57 - Did more level design

2020-11-25
	Took some days off since I had a rather long session on the 22nd.

	Morning: Played the level to get a feel for what needs adjustment
	Accomplishments:
		Environmental Damage now trigger Damage immunity timer
		Some Level modifications
		15:33
			Fixed Death animation issues bug
			Updraft no longer allows player to fall all the way through

	TODO: 
		MOVE_Swing still needs work, if you jump off at the right time the characters vertical velocity is to high
		Icicle needs adjusting but that could be polish work
		Enemy Bird with Character Inheritence 
		Updrafts that don't let players fall all the way through
		Decorating

	Evening:
		Game is actually coming together quite nicely and wrapping it up seems actually possible at this point.

		Playable Demo requirements:
			Enemy_Bird - Inherit from Character use MOVE_Flying AI nodes

			MOVE_Swing - Work around the hack of offsetting the velocity at certain angles, causing weird jumping

			Level Design - Needs at least 1/3 more level per level

			Level Decoration Design - Get Premade assets and sprinkle them throughout the level in order to give it a sense of space

			Animation..... none for the enemies as that is a lot of work

			Respawning at Rest Points

			Particles:
				Wind Gusts

			Sound FX:
				FootSteps
				Scythe Slash
				Enemy Frog Growl
				Enemy Worm crick
				Enemy Bird Caw
				Faint Breeze for background noise

			Tweak Gimmick to reach more difficult areas easier

2020-11-26
	Thanksgiving. Called the family had breakfast but no game development today, instead I am recording music for my project with Zack.
		Dance, Dance - Prank but also good experience
			Opening of dance dance, drum beat bassline shaker, maybe vocals

		Bass riffs - One you currently have recorded on your phone add a simple drum beat

		Mundane Bridge- No lyrics today just the chord progression you played with the other day maybe add a drum beat

		Stretch:
			Second Bassline

2020-11-29
	Spent a few days doing nothing but Music. I am not worried about neglecting the game as those few days were very productive and situation (ie being home alone).

	Pull Back camera and adjust Camera Bounding Box location
		For throwing obstacles at the player the camera is to close up for him to get a comfortagble read on the situation.

	Started looking into Vulkan once again, I want to pick at the Unreal Engines graphics engine to get an idea of how it works



2020-12-2
	As mentioned above I took a few days off my game to focus on music and it really paid off.

	Relating to my  game I told Zack I'd have a playable demo by december 18th, and there is a few things that need to be done by then. I will list them in order of importance.

	Finish Level
		Currently you need about 1/3 more level in order to get the idea down
	Decorate Level
		Sprinkle Assets and Textures to provide a sense of place
	Add Sound FX
		Foot steps, wind gust, monster growl, slash, regular ambiance (might be a little much)
	Handle Death
		Currently character falling below map leads to them just falling eternally
	Make Goal
		Level needs an ending and short animation
	Flying Enemy?


	Accomplishments
		Made a death floor for players who don't know how to stay within the level bounds.
		Death still needs work
		Wrote of list required for game



2020-12-7
	Worked on more of the level design and fixed a few oversights (Deleted the climb trigger)

2020-12-13
	Progress on the game has slowed to a halt as work has been taking a large amount of my time. It will suffer for 3 weeks when I am Vacationing as well.

	LetzteDelight

	Camera doesn't pan to character when outside bounds
	Replaced Geometry with static mesh called death block

2020-12-16
	Worked on own GameEngine. Believed that the VertexAttribPointer was the cause of the error but I believe it was the predefined marcos that was causing me headaches. Swapping GLEW for 
	glad and removing BINDVERTEXARRAY and GENVERTEXARRAYS macro made both of my shaders work. Go back and investigate that gl-Macros function and attempt to fix the error


	Didn't get any real work done on my Unreal Engine game today. Played the level a bit and messed around but that is all


2021-01-16
	I haven't touched this game in about a month and while that is disappointing today is a brand new day and I can start with a new routine to wrap up the game

	After playing through the level a few times I have some thoughts

	EnemyBird - Make it a character object so it can function with AI, I know you want to prove something to yourself but a finished game is what you want
	Updraft - Needs particle effects in order to inform the player what is happening
	Falling Spikes - Make them bigger and give obstacles to make them more threatening, I also think they don't even do damage anymore

2021-01-20
	I'm having difficulties getting back into the groove of working on a project, today however I spent some time reviewing the AI i had for the enemy Hawk since I am replacing it
	with an enemy character. Not to much changed, the behavior tree will need adjustments.

2021-01-21
	Trying to get back into a routine of working, need to make a check list for today

	Flying Enemy AI
		- Have since replaced the flying enemy pawn with enemy character to take advantage of the pre made code that comes with it
		- Set Up AI such that the EnemyFlying will act of its own accord and move based on whether a character is available

	Started working on the AI for enemy flying, got a visual on what it looks like but couldn't get the simple MoveTo to work well enough will revisit


NOTE ' is how you activate the gameplay debugger


2021-01-24
	Haven't touched the game in earnest the past few days as Ive been preoccupied with recording music

	I want to go through and wrap up the basics on the AI of the flying enemy

	EnemyFlying: Receive Damage, I have to work through this everytime I create a new enemy I need to figure out what to do in order to keep it consistent. 
					With my next project I am going to have an enemy base class
					DONE: Needed the "enemy" tag

				AI MoveTo - I need the behavior tree to move the enemy Flying toward a direction
					Still not responding, but I had to resolve an issue with Debug Logs prior to moving forward
					Selector with no condition never goes through with the second option, needed to swap it out for sequence
					Seems that when the entity interacts with the ground the movementmode becomes changes, I'll have to overload that function 	
2021-01-25
	Came back after spending a few hours on the game yesterday just to touch thing and polish everything up

	EnemyFlying: The AI is not implemented but the base of things are there
					Base: AI can Move
						  Can Give/Take Damage

				Needs more work on the actual AI movement
					- What to do when spot player
					- How big should the sense component be?
					- Avoid colliding with the floor
					- Don't let it move outside a restricted 2D range
				I believe that I need to overwrite the bird movement component as it keeps colliding in with the ground
				
	I've also thrown around the idea of having a monthly DevLog
		This month I have done XYZ for my game here is the before and after, I think it would be a good way to hold myself accountable

		Steps to do this:
			Screen Capture Software: Need to grab bits of code/unreal for my game
			Video Sequencer: Need to find a video sequencer program, adobe priemer is what Im expereienced in but I don't think its that useful now since I have to pay
			Audio Overlay: This one will be the simplest as I currently have all the tools ready to record an audio overlay
